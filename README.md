# Zo's solution to the Jotto Problem

Taking inspiration from Autralia's very own Matt Parker, I have decided to attempt finding all the solutions to the "Jotto Problem" in Go. This is meant to serve as a coding exercis, continuing my learning of Go.

For more information on the problem itself and the inspiration, see [Matt's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks).
